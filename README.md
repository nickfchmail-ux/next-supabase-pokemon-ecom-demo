Deployment to Vercel: https://next-pokemon-ecom-demo.vercel.app/

 This is an ecommerce project developed with NEXT.js, a react framework that links frontend and backend all together,  which makes building a website far more easier than before. The ecommerce store is called Poke 芒. The main reason pokemon is chosen as products because all the data are coming from open source API (Application Programming Interface), so it can save time.

 Around 70% of code is written by hand, and the rest is written by AI. The react APIs that are used in this project includes StanStack Query, Redux for remote and global state integration accross different pages.


<ins>Features</ins>


1. __Cart__ -
 The reason that redux suitable is found suitable in this project because that are lots of calculation neccessary to make the cart interactive throughout the application, like the quantity, products added to the cart and the billing amount dependent to the user's selections.

 During development, the difficulty encountered was loading the past user selections from database (Supabase). The data was not synchronized with the frontend application, or if it does, it would clear out all the data in the database, due to the fact that initially, the cart items in the frontend was empty. The solution fixing the problem is to create a state with "useState" function to ensure it would load the data from database first and then do the synchronization with "useEffect".

 The feature was suggested by the AI (grok), during which i interacted with and in the meanwhile asking AI for help, and fixed the problem until the wee hours.

2. __User Profile__ -
The TanStack Query help to handle user request only from the frontend, and give developer access to pending state when the POST request is submitted to the server. It is a convenience way to show a spinner UI and provide a good user experience during waiting for server's response.

3. __Infinite scrolling__ -
The TanStack Query also provides a very handy feature to adopt infinite scrolling just like Youtube. Initially, the product page will only show a little amount of products for sale. After the user scrolls nearly at the end of the div (the container), a POST request would be made to the server to load more products for display.

4. __Payment__ -
this is the coolest feature because it brings the project to a real world application where user can settle their payment online, but this is the most difficul part because of a lack of teaching courses from Udemy. Hopefully, by reading documentation from Stripe offical website and surfing Youtube for learning materials, the feature is finally finished and able to be launched.

<ins>UI</ins>

Nowadays, AI could really build amazing static pages within a minute with just a few prompts. In this project, the Home page, the About page were actually built with the help of AI. Although it is super easy to simply ask "help me build a home page for my pokemon store", the result is not 100% production ready. The issue that images and UI were broken always happened ,  so tweaking css was needed.

1. __Tailwind CSS__ -
Tailwind CSS offers css patterns for developer to quickly adopt a common UI. The good thing is that this applies to responsive layout display with mobile first media approach. It is very easy to set mobile UI with just "md:____" and it will make the layout adaptive to mobile screen.
