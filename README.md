 This is an ecommerce project developed by NEXT.js, a react framework that links frontend and backend all together,  which makes building a website far more easier than before. The ecommerce store is called Poke 芒. The main reason pokemon is chosen as my products is because all the data are coming from open souroce API (Application Programming Interface), so it can save time building my owns products.

 Arround 70% of code is written by hand, and the rest is written by AI, so it might look messy in some parts. The react APIs that are used in this project includes StanStack Query, Redux for remote and global state integration accross different pages.


Features



1. Cart
 The reason that i find redux suitable in this project because that are lots of calculation neccessary to make the cart interactive throughout the application, like the quantity, products added to the cart and the billing amount dependent to the user's selections.
